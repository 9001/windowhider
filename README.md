# windowhider
Hide windows by title or classname.

Default config hides the window glow of Visual Studio.

| Checkbox | What it does |
| -------- | ------------ |
| Nothing enabled | HIDE ALL THE THINGS |
| Window Title | Filter windows to hide by the text in its title bar |
| Window Class Name | Filter windows to hide by its classname (use `Spy++` to find it) |
| Parent Process | Window needs to be owned by `processname` (no `.exe` at the end) |

If you enable autohide and autostart and wanna change your config again, edit or delete the ini file:

    C:\Users\ed\AppData\Roaming\gtech\windowhider.ini
